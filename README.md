# Credit-Card-Fraud-Data-Exploration
Using data available on Kaggle to explore patterns in Credit Card Fraud

in addition, reading: <ins>Machine Learning for Credit Card Fraud Detection.</ins> Using the code from this text to ensure practice problems can be answered and see if the techniques in this text can be applied to the Kaggle data. 

## transaction-data-simulator.py 

This script follows the code in section 3.2 of <ins>Machine Learning for Credit Card Fraud Detection</ins>. This code explores generating an example dataset of fraud scenarios and visualizing this data.

## basline-feature-transformation.py

This script follows the code laid out in section 3.3 of <ins>Machine Learning for Credit Card Fraud Detection</ins>. The data generated in transaction-data-simulator.py is transformed and prepared for machine learning analysis. 

## ImportData.py

This script imports real-world credit card fraud data from Kaggle, and applies the methods used in <ins>Machine Learning for Credit Card Fraud Detection</ins> to develop insights from the data. 

More scripts will be added as needed as the exploration is still in progress
